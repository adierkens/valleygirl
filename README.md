# Valley Girl
A chrome extension for like, horrible people.

###Like Functionality
Valley Girl is a chrome extension which automatically clicks every Facebook like button everywhere on the web. Everywhere. Reading a feed? You're liking every post and comment on the entire page. Getting your daily fix of Total Sorority Move? You're liking every article with a like button, autonomously blasting your friends with the worst of the web.

###Like Hiding the Evidence
The only thing worse than liking everything is not being able to tell so we did that too: buttons are like greyed out, pop-ups are like removed, like counters are decremented, "you like this" grammar is like corrected, and styling is like reverted.

### Like Why????
Like why not?

###But Like, Really Why????
We didn't really make this with the expectation that people would like willingly install this on their browser -- it's more of a joke for like messing with your friends. If you can like actually find a legitimate use for this we'd love to hear it.
