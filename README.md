# Liker
A chrome extension for horrible people.

###Functionality
Liker is a chrome extension which automatically clicks every Facebook like button everywhere on the web. Everywhere. Reading a feed? You're liking every post and comment on the entire page. Getting your daily fix of Total Sorority Move? You're liking every article with a like button, autonomously blasting your friends with the worst of the web.

###Hiding the Evidence
The only thing worse than liking everything is not being able to tell so we did that too: buttons are greyed out, pop-ups are removed, like counters are decremented, "you like this" grammar is corrected, and styling is reverted.

###Why????
Why not?

###But really why????
We didn't really make this with the expectation that people would willingly install this on their browser -- it's more of a joke for messing with your friends. If you can actually find a legitimate use for this we'd love to hear it.
